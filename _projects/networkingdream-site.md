## Overview

NetworkingDream is a deliberately simple website built with **Jekyll and GitHub Pages**.  
Rather than acting as a portfolio or marketing surface, the site itself is treated as a **long-term project** — something to refine slowly as ideas and understanding evolve.

The emphasis is on:
- clarity over cleverness  
- durability over novelty  
- learning over output  

This project sets the foundation for everything else hosted here.

## Goals

- Create a structure that can last for years
- Keep content data-driven and easy to maintain
- Avoid unnecessary plugins or tooling
- Make writing and publishing feel frictionless
- Prioritize readability and accessibility

---

## What’s working well

- Clean content separation (posts, projects, tags)
- Minimal build complexity (GitHub Pages–safe)
- Fast load times and low maintenance
- Flexible enough to grow without refactoring

---

## Open questions

- How much automation is *helpful* versus distracting?
- Where should documentation live long-term?
- What deserves to be a project vs. a blog post?

These are intentionally left open.

## Status

This project is **active**.

Changes happen slowly and deliberately — mostly in response to real needs rather than planned roadmaps.

---

## Notes

This site will likely never feel “finished,” and that’s by design.  
If it continues to be useful — even quietly — it’s doing its job.
